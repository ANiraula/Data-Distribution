#Boxplot is another handy tool to spot outliers, it shows 1st, 2nd (mean), and 3rd Quartiles
#as well as maximum and minimum
#Outliers are either 3×IQR or more above the third quartile or 3×IQR or more below the first quartile.
#That is any data point 2 wiskers away from 1st or 3d Quartiles is potential outlier

#Identify kind of distribution that fits the data (need library "fitdistrplus")

#Major types of distribution:
#"norm", "lnorm", "pois", "exp", "gamma", "nbinom", "geom", "beta", "unif" and "logis"
#Fit couple of distributions
#Try fit normal distribution
fit.norm <- fitdist(GSP, "norm")
plot(fit.norm)
fit.norm$aic #Akaike information criterion shows relative quality of statistical models for a given dataset
#Try fit lognormal distribution
fit.lognorm <- fitdist(GSP, "lnorm")
plot(fit.lognorm)
fit.lognorm$aic#compares better than normal fit
#Try fit exponential distribution
fit.exp <- fitdist(GSP, "exp")
plot(fit.exp)
fit.exp$aic#compares better than normal fit
#Try fit logistic distribution
fit.logis <- fitdist(GSP, "logis")
plot(fit.logis)
fit.logis$aic#compares better than normal fit
#Thus, our data is best represented by lognormal distribution, folowed by exponential,
#logistic, and then by nirmal distributions
